Orinal dataset can be found on Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity website:

The datasets are in two parts and can be found here:

There has been some changes in the way this data was stored during the project and necessary changes will be required in the ipnb files to read the datasets correctly. Please note that this project is no longer maintained so I won't be updating the ipython notebooks

Update (Jan, 2024):

Unfortunately the dataset download link on the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity website is down (at the time of writing) and I've lost access to my uni google drive where I had uploaded the two-part dataset, so those URLs are also no longer working.

Not all is lost though as the original dataset is available on Kaggle (here's the download link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodrigorosasilva/cic-ddos2019-30gb-full-dataset-csv-files). You can download the dataset from there and run it through the `DDOS_dataProcessing.ipynb` file and store the resulting "cleaned" files. You'll need these processed data files to run the rest of the ipython notebooks.

As previously stated, this repo is not actively maintained but feel free to raise an issue if you have any questions and I will try to get back to you with an answer. Thanks :)
