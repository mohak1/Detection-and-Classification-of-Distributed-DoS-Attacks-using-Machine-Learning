# Detection-and-Classification-of-Distributed-DDoS-Attacks
This repository contains ipython notebooks which were used for detection and classification of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The dataset used in this study is called 'DDoS Evaluation Dataset (CICDDoS2019)' which was obtained from Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. The dataset contains thousands of synthesized DDoS attack scenarios which are based on actual attacks attacks that were reported in 2019. The results from this study have been used in a research work hence give a citation if you are using these notebooks/results from this repository.
